Sales Data Analysis: A Combined SQL and Python Approach
Introduction:
Welcome to the Sales Data Analysis project! This repository contains a comprehensive analysis of retail sales data using a combination of SQL and Python. The aim of this project is to demonstrate how SQL can be used for data extraction and initial preprocessing, while Python is utilized for advanced analysis, visualization, and predictive modeling.
Project Overview:
In this project, we explore and analyze sales data from a retail dataset. The dataset includes information such as weekly sales, store IDs, holiday flags, temperature, fuel prices, CPI (Consumer Price Index), and unemployment rates. The analysis is designed to uncover insights into sales trends, the impact of various factors on sales, and predictive modeling.
Key Components:
1.	SQL Queries (Sales_Data_Queries.sql):
o	Purpose: Efficiently extract, aggregate, and filter data from the database.
o	Key Queries:
	Summary statistics for key variables.
	Distribution of weekly sales.
	Sales trends over time.
	Comparisons of sales on holidays versus non-holidays.
	Preparation of data for advanced analysis.
2.	Python Analysis (Sales_Data_Analysis_Python.ipynb):
o	Purpose: Perform advanced analysis, visualization, and predictive modeling.
o	Key Components:
	Data Import and Cleaning: Load and prepare data using Pandas.
	Data Analysis: Perform statistical analysis, visualize trends, and explore correlations.
	Predictive Modeling: Build and evaluate models to predict weekly sales.
	Reporting: Generate visual reports and summaries of findings.
Objectives:
•	Understand Sales Trends: Analyze how weekly sales vary over time and identify any significant patterns or anomalies.
•	Evaluate Factors Affecting Sales: Assess the impact of variables such as temperature, fuel prices, CPI, and unemployment on sales performance.
•	Compare Sales Performance: Investigate differences in sales on holidays versus non-holidays and across different stores.
•	Predict Future Sales: Develop and validate predictive models to forecast future sales based on historical data.
