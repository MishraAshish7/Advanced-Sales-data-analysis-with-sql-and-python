-- Easy Level

-- Summary Statistics:
-- Question: What are the mean, median, and standard deviation of Weekly_Sales, Temperature, Fuel_Price, CPI, and Unemployment?
-- Objective: Obtain basic summary statistics for numerical columns.

-- Distribution of Weekly Sales:
-- Question: What is the frequency distribution of Weekly_Sales?
-- Objective: Understand the range and frequency of different sales values.

-- Trend of Weekly Sales Over Time:
-- Question: How do Weekly_Sales values change over time?
-- Objective: Visualize or extract sales data over time.

-- Intermediate Level

-- Correlation Analysis:
-- Question: What are the correlations between Weekly_Sales and other variables like Temperature, Fuel_Price, CPI, and Unemployment?
-- Objective: Identify relationships between Weekly_Sales and other variables. (Note: SQL alone doesnâ€™t compute correlation directly; you might use a subquery or external tools for advanced correlation analysis.)

-- Sales Comparison on Holidays vs. Non-Holidays:
-- Question: How do Weekly_Sales compare on holidays versus non-holidays?
-- Objective: Compare sales performance on holidays and non-holidays.

-- Average Sales by Store:
-- Question: What is the average Weekly_Sales for each store?
-- Objective: Compare average sales performance across stores.

-- Sales by Temperature Ranges:
-- Question: How do Weekly_Sales vary within different temperature ranges?
-- Objective: Analyze sales performance within specified temperature brackets.

-- Advanced Level

-- Impact Analysis by Store:
-- Question: How does the impact of Temperature on Weekly_Sales vary across different stores?
-- Objective: Examine how the relationship between Temperature and Weekly_Sales differs by store.

-- Predictive Modeling Preparation:
-- Question: How can you aggregate and prepare data for predictive modeling, including calculating rolling averages or creating lagged variables?
-- Objective: Prepare data for predictive modeling and time-series analysis.

-- Autocorrelation in Sales Data:
-- Question: Is there evidence of autocorrelation in Weekly_Sales data?
-- Objective: Identify patterns where past sales values influence future sales (note: autocorrelation is more complex to handle directly in SQL and may require integration with analytical tools).

-- Variability with Economic Indicators:
-- Question: How does the variability in Weekly_Sales change with different levels of CPI and Unemployment?
-- Objective: Analyze how economic indicators affect the variability in sales data.

-- Time Series Forecasting Data Preparation:
-- Question: How can you prepare your data for time series forecasting, such as creating features for trends or seasonal effects?
-- Objective: Prepare data for advanced time series forecasting techniques.
